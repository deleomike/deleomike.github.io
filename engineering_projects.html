    <h4>
        Digital Finite Impulse Response Filter (FIR) on PIC32
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <u>
            Penn State Behrend - April 2018
        </u>
    </h4>
    Created 64 Tap FIR filter, and implemented C code design on the Embedded PIC32MX340F512H.
    <br>Takes Analog input, runs data through the FIR, and outputs the value within 1ms.
    <h4>

        <u>
            Penn State Behrend March 2018 – March 2018
        </u>
    </h4>
    Created Simulation of Superscalar MIPS Architecture.
    <br>ISA input, Pipeline output with hazards stalled

    <h4>
        BattleShip - The Classic Board Game, now on a Microprocessor!
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <u>
            Penn State Behrend November 2017 – December 2017
        </u>
    </h4>
    Programmed with MIPS Assembly Language.
    <br>BattleShip with bitmap display, design size: 2700 lines of code, and features of Normal Mode or Salvo Mode.
    <h4>
        A Simple Implementation of PacMan in VHDL
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <u>
            Penn State Behrend November 2017 – December 2017
        </u>
    </h4>
    Created a PacMan-like game with VHDL for the Artix 7 Nexys 4 DDR using Xlinix Vivado.
    <br>Learned how to design a VGA, PS2-Keyboard Interface, ROM, RAM, Flip Flops, Debouncer.
    <h4>
        Overlay Generator (For Pac Man VHDL Application)
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <u>
            Penn State Behrend December 2017
        </u>
    </h4>
    Generated the 1280 x 1024-pixel frame and smaller inner Background for PacMan0.2 with C++.
    <br>Overlay file of 1. 3M+ Pixels, or 7M+ ASCII Characters. Design Time: 30 minutes.
    <h4>
        GUI Board Game, Inspired by Bugs Bunny and Characters
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <u>
            Penn State Behrend March 2017 – May 2017
