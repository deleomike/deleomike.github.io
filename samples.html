        1. MIPS SuperScalar Processor Simulation
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        The Superscalar Processor Simulation was a research project that I did for my Computer Architecture
        <br>
        course. Essentially, it tested the idea that one could make a simulation of a processor that has several
        <br>
        inputs of instructions and can be used to study algorithms used to schedule the instructions such that the
        <br>
        instructions are executed quickly and with no obstructions present.
        <br>

        I accomplished the simulation portion, however I did not implement the algorithm. The room for an
        <br>
        algorithm is there, and the simulation is built around the implementation of some algorithm.
