        Through my freshman year,  I played rugby at GCC.
        I learned how to work on a team, and take constructive criticism.
        I learned how to be adaptable, and handle situations that go off the rails.
        <br><br>
        I have had to deal with situations where one of my teammmates goes down
        and i have to cover for them and provide support. I also learned that you
        have failed at learning something only when you give up. Rugby was a very alien
        sport to me, but i got better and didn't give up

        </h4>

        
        Through my sophomore to Junior year I played lacrosse at PSB. I had to pick
        up an entirely new sport again. This sport along with rugby both had large learning
        curves, and going through that taught me that there is nothing intimidating about
        learning something new. 
        <br><br>
        I had to learn plays, and I got to act as leadership on the team as the vice
        president of the club for a year.
