        Rugby at Grove City College

    Through my freshman year,  I played rugby at GCC.
    I learned how to work on a team, and take constructive criticism.
    I learned how to be adaptable, and handle situations that go off the rails.
    <br><br>
    I have had to deal with situations where one of my teammmates goes down
    and i have to cover for them and provide support. I also learned that you
    have failed at learning something only when you give up. Rugby was a very alien
    sport to me, but i got better and didn't give up.

        <u>
            2016 - 2018
        </u>
    </h4>
    
    
    Through my sophomore to Junior year I played lacrosse at PSB. I had to pick
    up an entirely new sport again. This sport along with rugby both had large learning
    curves, and going through that taught me that there is nothing intimidating about
    learning something new.
    <br><br>
    I had to learn plays, and I got to act as leadership on the team as the vice
    president of the club for a year.

        SAMPLES OF MY WORK
    </h3>
    
    In this page I have curated some snippets of code that I personally feel best represent my skills in coding.

    <h3>
        1. MIPS SuperScalar Processor Simulation
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        The Superscalar Processor Simulation was a research project that I did for my Computer Architecture
        <br>
        course. Essentially, it tested the idea that one could make a simulation of a processor that has several
        <br>
        inputs of instructions and can be used to study algorithms used to schedule the instructions such that the
        <br>
        instructions are executed quickly and with no obstructions present.
        <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I accomplished the simulation portion, however I did not implement the algorithm. The room for an
        <br>
        algorithm is there, and the simulation is built around the implementation of some algorithm.
        <br>
